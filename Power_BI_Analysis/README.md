>
>Data Cleansing: Identifying and handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
>
>Type Management: Performing necessary data type transformations to ensure correct analytical operations (e.g., date formats, numerical conversion).

**Conclusion:**

As a result of this project, I successfully created a comprehensive set of analytical dashboards and presentation-ready materials. 
Such a presentation can be used at corporate events, but also for large audiences like medical conferences.
The dashboard uses a large font size and minimal graphics per slide, making it ideal for large-scale projector display in big halls or for investigation on your own.
