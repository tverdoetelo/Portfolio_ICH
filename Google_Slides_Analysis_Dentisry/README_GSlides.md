**Conclusion:**

As a result of this project, I successfully created a presentation with printout materials. 
Such a presentation can be used at corporate events, but also for large audiences like medical conferences.
The presentation is made in a neutral style, so that it is suitable for various events. 
The first part uses a large font size and a small number of graphics on the slides, so that it can be shown on the projector in large halls.
In addition, dashboards have been created that can be used for demonstration in small rooms when more confidence that people will see all the details. 
These dashboards can also be used as distribution materials.
